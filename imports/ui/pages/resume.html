              <p class="text-justify">The Center for Digital Humanities is responsible for administering the completion of digitalizing and preserving pre-information era artifacts. When I was hired, I was tasked to administer the development of a website that revolves around an 18<sup>th</sup>-century botanist, his diary, and the specimens he collected during his lifetime. During and after the completion of that project, my tasks included design and development of eight more projects.</p>

Having only worked for a localized and non-profit business, this change came with many new experiences.
